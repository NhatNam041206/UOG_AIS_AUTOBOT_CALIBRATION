# Python MQTT Bridge

This flow keeps the keyboard connected to the Raspberry Pi while the
vision controller publishes steering angles over MQTT.

## Files

- `scripts/rpi_mqtt_bridge.py`: Raspberry Pi keyboard controller with MQTT servo subscribe
- `scripts/mqtt_servo_command.py`: test publisher for servo angle
- `drivers/servo_driver.py`: vision-side MQTT publisher

## Raspberry Pi Side

Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install -y pigpio python3-pigpio python3-gpiozero
pip install evdev paho-mqtt python-dotenv
sudo systemctl enable --now pigpiod
```

Run:

```bash
MQTT_BROKER_HOST=192.168.1.50 SERVO_PIN=19 python scripts/rpi_mqtt_bridge.py
```

Optional controller tuning:

```bash
GAMEPAD_DEVICE=/dev/input/event5
GAMEPAD_STEER_DEADZONE=0.12
GAMEPAD_DRIVE_DEADZONE=0.20
INVERT_STEER_AXIS=false
INVERT_DRIVE_AXIS=false
```

If `pigpiod` is running on a different host, set:

```bash
PIGPIO_HOST=127.0.0.1
PIGPIO_PORT=8888
```

Keyboard controls remain local:

- `W`: forward
- `S`: backward
- `A`: steer left
- `D`: steer right
- `C`: center steering
- `X`: stop
- `L`: lock
- `U`: unlock
- `1`: center angle +1
- `2`: center angle -1
- `Q`: quit

Controller controls are also supported when a gamepad is detected:

- right stick X: steering
- left stick Y: base forward/backward
- `Y`: toggle drive local + steering from MQTT on/off
- `A`: stop base
- `B`: center steering
- `LB`: lock
- `RB`: unlock
- `X`: center angle `-1`
- D-pad up/down: center angle `+1 / -1`
- `START`: quit

When `A`, `D`, or `C` is pressed, local steering temporarily overrides the
MQTT angle stream. When the user stops steering, remote servo control
resumes automatically.

If the configured `KEYBOARD_DEVICE` does not exist, the bridge still starts
and remote MQTT steering continues to work; local keyboard control is simply
disabled for that session.

If a controller is present, it acts as another local manual override source.
When the stick/buttons return to neutral, remote MQTT steering resumes after
the normal `MANUAL_STEER_HOLD` window.

Press `Y` once to enable controller drive with MQTT steering. Press `Y`
again to return to full local controller steering. When the MQTT steering
mode is enabled, any active controller steering override is cleared right
away, so MQTT steering takes over immediately while left-stick drive
continues to work.

By default, the bridge now holds the last MQTT steering angle until a new
message arrives:

```bash
REMOTE_SERVO_HOLD_LAST=true
```

If you want the old timeout behavior back, set:

```bash
REMOTE_SERVO_HOLD_LAST=false
REMOTE_SERVO_TIMEOUT=0.6
```

## Accepted Servo Payload

The Python bridge accepts either:

- plain float payload, for example `90.0` or `-8.0`
- JSON payload, for example `{"type":"angle","angle":90}` or `{"type":"center"}`

If the payload already matches the local signed steering range
`-65 .. -8 .. 60`, it is used directly. Otherwise it is remapped from the
configured remote input range.

## Vision Side

Enable MQTT publishing in `.env`:

```bash
DRIVER_SERVO_MQTT_ENABLED=true
DRIVER_SERVO_BRIDGE_ENABLED=false
MQTT_BROKER_HOST=192.168.1.50
MQTT_BROKER_PORT=1883
MQTT_SERVO_TOPIC=car/servo/angle
```

If you want the vision side to publish the same signed steering angles used
on the Raspberry Pi, also set:

```bash
SERVO_CENTER_ANGLE=-8
DRIVER_SERVO_ANGLE_MIN=-90
DRIVER_SERVO_ANGLE_MAX=90
```

Then run the existing app as usual:

```bash
python main.py --debug
```

## Manual MQTT Test

Without running vision, you can publish a test angle directly:

```bash
python scripts/mqtt_servo_command.py -8
python scripts/mqtt_servo_command.py 90
```

## Notes

- `SERVO_PIN` defaults to `19`
- default base pins are `17`, `27`, `22`
- base output is driven through `pigpio`
- servo output now uses `gpiozero.AngularServo` with `PiGPIOFactory`
- gamepad auto-detect matches names like `edra`, `joystick`, `gamepad`, `controller`, `pad`
- servo MQTT angle is published as a retained message
- broker host and topic must match on both machines
