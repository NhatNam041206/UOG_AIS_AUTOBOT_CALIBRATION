# Current Core Architecture

## Shared Calibration Path

```text
live camera or offline video frame
  -> UnifiedCalibrator.process_frame(frame, frame_num)
  -> VisionProcessor preprocessing and Hough extraction
  -> opposite-slope pair selection
  -> GeometryCalculator
  -> SteeringController
  -> CalibrationResult
```

Each frame passes through vision extraction and pair selection once.

`CalibrationResult` centralizes the steering angle, control state, observation
angle, calibration-active flag, telemetry snapshot, and visualization debug
data. Runtime entrypoints consume this result instead of recalculating
calibration values.

Unexpected calibration and output-side failures are raised as
`CalibrationProcessingError`. The diagnostic identifies the frame, stage,
process, exception type, and detail while preserving the original traceback.
The live runtime logs this context before safe shutdown; offline processing
logs it before re-raising.

## Runtime Ownership

`main.py` owns live lifecycle concerns: camera recovery, control subscriptions,
route sessions, actuators, streaming, CSV/video output, and safe shutdown. It
calls `process_frame()` and does not implement calibration mathematics.

`process_video.py` owns offline video input and output lifecycle. It calls
`UnifiedCalibrator.update()`, a compatibility wrapper around `process_frame()`
that applies the current telemetry and visualization side effects.

## Current Calibration Behavior

`VisionProcessor` crops the top `ROI_HEIGHT_PCT` of the frame, converts it to
grayscale, blurs it, runs Canny, and extracts probabilistic Hough segments.
The current geometric filter rejects vertical and near-horizontal lines and
selects the longest line from each slope sign.

The approved next geometry behavior is to select the most opposite valid
slopes. It will be implemented and tested in its own approved gate.

`GeometryCalculator` projects selected lines to the frame bottom, calculates
their infinite-line intersection, and maps vanishing-point x to a linear
`0..180` angle proxy.

`SteeringController` applies missing-geometry centering, danger overrides,
hysteresis, and frame-to-frame PD correction. It does not yet use elapsed time
or the configured integral gain.

## Remaining Responsibility Problems

- Calibration components remain together in `unified_calibration_components.py`.
- `UnifiedCalibrator.update()` still combines result consumption with
  telemetry and visualization side effects.
- `TelemetryLogger` owns CSV, overlays, video, streaming, artifacts, and sleep.
- Components still exchange broad telemetry/debug dictionaries.
